I decided that it would be best to not allow errorTypes to propagate as long as
we can make a guess about the intended type.  This will allow us to catch as
many errors in a single compilation as possible

ConditionalExprs wll not be set to error type if only the condition expression
is erroneous.  This is because it may still be perfectly clear which type the
expression is meant to be, as long as the true and false expressions are of the
same type.

Additionally, our analyzer does NOT run checks on the true/false expressions of a
conditional statement because there is no such error to report in errors.cc.  Know that
this decision was deliberate.

However, we decided to still set conditional statements to errorType when the
intended type of the expression cannot be semantically deduced. We still want to
avoid unnecessary error cascading wherever possible.
